# Self-Corrective Coding Agent

The Self-Corrective Coding Agent is an automated tool designed to assist developers in writing code and fixing errors automatically. It utilizes a language model to generate code snippets and employs a self-corrective mechanism to address any errors encountered during code execution.

## Features

- **Automated Code Generation**: Generates code snippets based on user specifications and requirements.
- **Error Detection and Correction**: Identifies and resolves errors in the generated code using a self-corrective mechanism.
- **Language Model Integration**: Utilizes Mixtral language model for code generation and error correction.
- **Conda Environment Integration**: Executes generated code within a specified Conda environment for dependency management.
- **Interactive Feedback**: Provides interactive feedback to the user during code execution and error correction.

## Usage

To use the Self-Corrective Coding Agent, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up a Conda environment with the required dependencies.(groq for LLM inferenceÂ )
3. Run the `main.py` script to start the self-corrective coding agent.
4. Provide input specifications or requirements for code generation.
5. Review the generated code and any errors detected by the agent.
6. Optionally, provide feedback to improve the agent's performance.
7. Iterate as needed to refine the generated code and achieve the desired outcome.
